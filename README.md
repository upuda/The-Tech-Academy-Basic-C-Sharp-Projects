# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects.
Welcome to the repository for my coding projects from The Tech Academy's C# and .NET Framework course.
This repository aims to:
- Document my journey as I learn and practice C# and .NET programming
- Provide organized and well-documented project files
- Serve as a reference for future coding endeavors

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET framework:
Projects:
- **Shipping Quote Calculator** - A console based applciation that allows users to input package details
- **Student Database - Entity Framework (Code First)** - A simple Entity Frameowrk code first console applciation that creates a student database and adds a sample student record.
